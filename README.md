# Cricket-Legends-Image-Classifire
In this project I used the cricket legends database that contain images of 30 different cricketers. I used OpenCV tool for image processing. After using necessary Data-science techniques on the dataset, build a machine learning model that can classify the images of different cricketers.

        Image Classifire.ipynb - juputer notebook where done all the processes
        test_images - Done test of image detection on these images
        Cricket_legends.csv - cricketers images used in this database
        opencv -  OpenCv codes used for image detection
        saved_model.pkl - File of ready model that can deploy in the website using python flask
